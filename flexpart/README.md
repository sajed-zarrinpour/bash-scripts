# FLEXPART 9.3
### NOTE:

I installed this software once for one of my friends and it was a headache!
I did then copy everything line by line to the script presented, but as a matter
of fact I did not run the whole script on a computer yet, though I did executed
it line by line and I know it will work over all. So, you may have to do some
extra work to get it done. Overall, I think it may be a good point to start if
you are lost as I once was.

This script had written on an *ubuntu* machine so it uses the **apt** package
manager but it must not be so hard to get it up and runing on other operating
systems (I am a *manjaro* user!).
There are a lot of dependencies which you shall download beforehead and put
them in this folder.

Here is the list of them :

- emos_000392.tar.gz
- FLEXPART_90.02.tar.gz
- grib_api-1.9.18.tar
- jasper-1.900.1.zip
- openjpeg-master.zip

Also, you must download [this script](https://gist.github.com/danwild/d7225afe4b7dbdeeb87982f0e71012f3) and put it in the current directory.
