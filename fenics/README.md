### My bash scripts to install special softwares
There is a lot of technical softwares out there which has a hard hard installation proccess.
I encountered some of them and I decided to make the instruction to install each as a script.
If you have encountered such a software which you had needed for your **academic usage** and you could not install it 
on your linux machine, you are welcome to mail me at `sa.zarrinpour@iasbs.ac.ir` (Institute email) Or `samim56b@gmail.com` (Personal Email) with subject `"Software Installation Problem"`.

**please note that I cannot help you with softwares which need a payed license unless you provide a license for me**
